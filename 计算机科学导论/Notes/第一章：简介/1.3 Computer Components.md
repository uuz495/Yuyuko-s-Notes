## **1.3 Computer Components**

A computer is made up of **three main parts**:

1. **Computer Hardware**
2. **Data**
3. **Computer Software**

## âœ… **1.3.1 Computer Hardware**

* Modern computer hardware is based on the **Von Neumann model**.
* It has **four main parts** 

  * **Memory**
  * **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
  * **Control Unit**
  * **Input/Output subsystem**
* There can be **different types of memory and input/output devices**, depending on the computer.
* More detailed explanations of computer hardware will be given later in ***Chapter 5***.

### âœ… **Summary**

A computer is built from **hardware**, **software**, and **data**. The **hardware** follows the Von Neumann model and includes **memory**, **processing units**, and **input/output devices**.

Hereâ€™s a clear, easy-to-understand explanation of **Section 1.3.2: Data** from the von Neumann model:

---

## âœ… **1.3.2 Data**

### ðŸ“Œ What is data in computers?

According to the **von Neumann model**, a computer is a **data processing machine** that:

* Takes input data
* Processes it
* Outputs the result

---

### ðŸ“Œ How is data stored?

* If a computer is electronic, the best way is to use **electrical signals**.
* These signals have only **two states**:

  * Signal **present** (1)
  * Signal **absent** (0)

So, computers store data in **two states** (binary: 0 and 1).

---

### ðŸ“Œ What about other data types?

* In real life, data is more complex:

  * Numbers can be from 0 to 9 (ten states)
  * Text, images, audio, video are much more complicated

* These types cannot be stored directly in computers. They must be **converted into binary** (0s and 1s).

* In ***Chapter 3***, you will learn **how to store different types of data** as binary patterns.
* In ***Chapter 4***, you will learn **how computers manipulate data** stored as binary.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Organizing data

* Inside computers, data is stored as binary.
* Outside computers, data comes in many forms.
* The field of **data organization** studies how to organize data before storing it.
* Data is organized in a hierarchy:

  * **Small units â†’ Larger units â†’ Even larger units**, and so on.
* You will learn more about **data organization in** ***Chapters 11â€“14***.

---

### âœ… **Summary**

Computers store **all data as binary** (0s and 1s), even though real-world data is more complex. Data is organized systematically before storage, and understanding this will be explored further in later chapters.

Hereâ€™s a clear summary and explanation of **Section 1.3.3: Computer Software**:

## âœ… **1.3.3 Computer Software**


---

### ðŸ“Œ Programs must be stored in memory

* In the von Neumann model, programs are stored in the computer's memory along with data.
* This allows the computer to read instructions directly from memory.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Programs are sequences of instructions

A program consists of **instructions executed in order**. Each instruction works on one or more pieces of data. **Instructions can change the effects of previous instructions**.
* Example: A program might input two numbers, add them, then print the resultâ€”composed of a series of instructions.


Instructions make programming **reusable and manageable**. Instead of writing a unique program for every task, programmers combine a **set of basic instructions**. This makes writing many different programs easier and more efficient.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithms

* Programming requires **solving problems step-by-step**.
* The step-by-step solution is called an **algorithm**.
* Learning how to design algorithms is essential in computer science ***(covered in Chapter 8)***.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Computer languages

* Initially, only **machine language** (binary code) was used.
* To solve this, **computer languages** use symbols to represent instructions (like words).
* You will study **programming languages** ***in Chapter 9***.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Software engineering

Beyond writing programs, **software engineering** is about designing structured, well-organized programs. Programs must follow rules and principles to be reliable and maintainable.
* This topic is covered in ***Chapter 10***.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Operating systems

* Many instructions are common to all programs (e.g., **handling input/output**).
* Instead of rewriting these instructions every time, they are written once and managed by the **operating system**.
* The **OS** manages computer resources and helps programs access hardware.
* You will learn about **operating systems** in ***Chapter 7***.

---

### âœ… **Summary**

Computer software is based on **programs** made of **instructions stored in memory**. These **instructions** form **algorithms**, **combined through programming languages**. Software engineering ensures good program design, and operating systems manage shared resources to support all programs efficiently.
