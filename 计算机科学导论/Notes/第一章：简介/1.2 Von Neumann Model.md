## **1.2 Von Neumann Model**

**John von Neumann** made an important suggestion:

> Since **programs** and **data** are logically similar, they should both be **stored in memory**.

This became the basis of the **Von Neumann Architecture**, which is how almost all modern computers are built.

### **1.2.1 The Four Subsystems of a Computer**

Computers based on the Von Neumann model have **four main parts**:

---

### ðŸ“Œ 1. **Memory**

* Acts like the computerâ€™s **storage**.
* Stores both **programs** (instructions) and **data** during processing.
* It is like a **workspace** where the computer can quickly read and write information.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

* This is where the **real work** happens.
* Performs **math operations** (like adding, subtracting) and **logic operations** (like comparing numbers).
* Example: Add two numbers, or check if one number is bigger than another.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 3. **Control Unit**

* The **brain** that tells other parts what to do.
* Controls:

  * The **memory**
  * The **ALU**
  * The **input/output devices**

It fetches instructions from memory, decides what they mean, and tells the computer how to carry them out.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 4. **Input / Output (I/O)**

* **Input devices** bring **data and programs** into the computer.

  * Example: Keyboard, mouse, disk (reading)
* **Output devices** send **results** out of the computer.

  * Example: Monitor, printer, disk (writing)

### âœ… **Conclusion**

The **Von Neumann model** describes a modern computer using four key parts: **memory, ALU, control unit, and I/O**.
This design is still used today and is powerful because it allows a single machine to run many kinds of programs, just by loading new instructions into memory.

## **1.2.2 The Stored Program Concept**

### ðŸ“Œ What is it?

The **stored program concept** is part of the **Von Neumann model**.
It means that a **computer stores both the program (instructions)** and **the data** in its **memory**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Before (Early Computers)

* In early computers:

  * Only **data** was stored in memory.
  * The **program** (how to process the data) was **hard-wired** into the machine.
  * To change the program, you had to physically **change switches or wires**â€”very slow and inflexible.

---

### ðŸ“Œ After (Von Neumann Model)

* In modern computers:

  * **Both the program and the data** are stored in memory.
  * You can easily change the task of the computer by **loading a new program**, not by rewiring anything.

---

### ðŸ“Œ One Common Format: Binary

* Since both the **data** and the **program** are stored in memory, they must be stored in the **same format**.
* That format is **binary**â€”a sequence of **0s and 1s**.

---

### âœ… **Conclusion**

The **stored program concept** allows modern computers to be flexible and powerful.
By keeping both programs and data in memory, computers can easily switch tasks and handle many operationsâ€”all controlled by software, not hardware rewiring.

## **1.2.3 Sequential Execution of Instructions**

### ðŸ“Œ What is it?

In the **Von Neumann model**, a program is made up of a limited number of **instructions** (commands).

---

### ðŸ“Œ How are instructions executed?

* The **control unit** does three things for each instruction:

  1. **Fetch** the instruction from memory
  2. **Decode** (understand) the instruction
  3. **Execute** (perform) the instruction

* Instructions are executed **one after another**, in order. This is called **sequential execution**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ What about jumps?

* Sometimes, an instruction can tell the control unit to **jump** to a different instruction (like going back or skipping ahead).
* Even with jumps, instructions are still executed **one at a time**, just in a different order.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Todayâ€™s computers

* Originally, computers had to execute instructions strictly **one by one**.
* Todayâ€™s computers can execute programs in a way that is **most efficient**, sometimes not strictly sequentially, but the basic idea of step-by-step execution still holds.

---

### âœ… **Conclusion**

Programs in Von Neumann computers run by executing instructions one after another.
This **sequential execution** ensures clear and simple control of what the computer does.
