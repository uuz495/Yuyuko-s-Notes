## **2.2 Positional Number Systems**

In a positional number system, the position a symbol occupies in the number determines the value it represents.

A number written in a positional system is represented as:

$$
\pm (S_{K-1} S_{K-2} \dots S_1 S_0 . S_{-1} S_{-2} \dots S_{-L})_b
$$

Its value is calculated as:

$$
\pm (S_{K-1} \times b^{K-1} + S_{K-2} \times b^{K-2} + \dots + S_1 \times b^1 + S_0 \times b^0 + S_{-1} \times b^{-1} + S_{-2} \times b^{-2} + \dots + S_{-L} \times b^{-L})
$$

Where:
- \( S_i \) is the symbol (digit) at position \( i \)
- \( b \) is the base (or radix), equal to the total number of symbols
- \( \pm \) indicates that the number can be positive or negative

The **non-negative powers** of \( b \) correspond to the **integral part**, and the **negative powers** correspond to the **fractional part**.
