### **Number Systems Overview**

A **number system** (or numeral system) defines **how we represent numbers using symbols** (called **digits**).

There are two main types of number systems:

* **Nonpositional systems**: The position of a symbol doesn't affect its value.
* **Positional systems**: The **position** of each digit **does** matter.
