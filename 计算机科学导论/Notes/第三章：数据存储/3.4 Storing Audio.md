## ðŸŽ§ 3.4 Storing Audio

Audio is an **analog signal** that **varies continuously** 

To store audio in a computer, we must **convert it into a digital format** using three main steps:

**Sampling**, **Quantization**, and **Encoding**.

---

## âœ… 3.4.1 Sampling

**Sampling** is the process of selecting specific points in time and recording the **amplitude** (intensity) of the audio signal.

### ðŸ“Œ Sampling Rate

The **sampling rate** is how many samples are taken per second, measured in **samples/second** or **Hz**.

---

## âœ… 3.4.2 Quantization

Each sampled value is a **real number**, which must be converted into an **integer** to be stored digitally.

**Quantization** rounds each sample to the nearest integer.

> Example:
>
> * 17.2 â†’ 17
> * 17.7 â†’ 18

---

## âœ… 3.4.3 Encoding

Each **quantized** sample is  **encoded** into a **bit pattern**.

* Some systems use **signed integers**
* Others use **unsigned integers**


---

## ðŸ“Œ Bit Depth (Bits per Sample)

This determines **how many bits** are used to represent each sample:

* Common depths: **8, 16, 24, 32 bits**


---

## ðŸ“Œ Bit Rate

The **bit rate(R)** is **the number of bits** needed to store 1 second of audio. And we have the formula 

**$$R = S Ã— B$$**

Where:

* **$S$** = number of **samples per second**
* **$B$** = number of **bits per sample**

> Example:
**$$S = 40,000 samples/s$$** 
**$$B = 16 bits/sample$$**
**$$â‡’ R = 40,000 Ã— 16 = 640,000 bits/second = 640 kbps$$**

## âœ… 3.4.4 Audio Encoding Standards

### ðŸ“Œ MP3 (MPEG Layer 3)

* Based on video compression (MPEG)
* Uses:

  * **44,100 samples/second**
  * **16 bits/sample**
  * **Bit rate**: 705,600 bits/second
