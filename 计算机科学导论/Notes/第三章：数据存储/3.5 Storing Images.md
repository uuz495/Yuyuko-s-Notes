## âœ… 3.5 Storing Images

Computers store images using two main techniques:

* **Raster graphics** 
* **Vector graphics** 

---

## âœ… 3.5.1 Raster Graphics

Raster graphics are used to store **analog images** like photographs. These images must be **scanned** into a digital format using **pixels**.

### ðŸ“Œ What is a Pixel?

A **pixel** (short for *picture element*) is the **smallest unit** of an image. Each pixel holds one **color value**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Resolution

Resolution refers to the **number of pixels per inch** (or per unit of space). Higher resolution means:

* More detail
* Smoother images
* Larger file sizes

---

### ðŸ“Œ Color Depth

**Color depth** refers to how many bits are used to store each pixelâ€™s color. More bits mean more colors.


---

### âœ… True-Color (24-bit Color)

* Uses **24 bits per pixel**

  * 8 bits for **Red**
  * 8 bits for **Green**
  * 8 bits for **Blue**

Each 8-bit value can be between 0 and 255, so:

* Total possible colors:

  **$$
  2^8 \times 2^8 \times 2^8 = 2^{24} = 16,\!777,\!216 \text{ colors}
  $$**


---

### âœ… Indexed Color 

* Stores only a **small subset** of colors (usually 256)
* Each pixel stores an **index** (0â€“255) instead of the full color
* Each index points to a color in a **palette**

Here is a **clear, organized summary** of **Section 3.5.2: Vector Graphics**, comparing it with raster graphics, explaining key concepts, and giving real-world examples.

## âœ… 3.5.2 Vector Graphics

### ðŸ“Œ What is Vector Graphics?

Vector graphics store images **as mathematical formulas**, not as individual pixels. Image is made from **geometric shapes** like:

* Lines
* Circles
* Rectangles
* Polygons
