## **3.1 DATA TYPES**

### ✅ **Different Forms of Data**

Modern data can appear in many forms:

* **Numbers** (e.g., for calculations)
* **Text** (e.g., in documents)
* **Audio** (e.g., music or speech)
* **Images** (e.g., photos, illustrations)
* **Video** (e.g., movies, animations)

#### 💡 Examples of Programs Using These Data Types:

* 🧮 **Engineering software**: processes **numbers** — solving equations, doing arithmetic, etc.
* 📝 **Word processors**: manipulate **text** — justifying, moving, or deleting text.
* 🎵 **Audio software**: records and plays **sound**.
* 🖼️ **Image editors**: work with **pictures** — create, resize, rotate, etc.
* 🎬 **Video programs**: play and even create **movies** with special effects.

> 🔁 All of these combined (text, audio, images, video, numbers) are called **multimedia**.

## **3.1.1 Data Inside The Computer**

### 🔹 **What Is a Bit?**

* A **bit** (short for “binary digit”) is the **smallest piece of data** in a computer.
* It can only have one of two values:

  **$$
  \text{0 or 1}
  $$**
* Think of a bit like a **light switch**:

  * **1 = ON**
  * **0 = OFF**

### 🔸 **Bit Patterns & Bytes**

* No matter what type of data (text, image, number, etc.), the computer stores all of them in **bit patterns**.
* A **bit pattern** is a group of bits (e.g., 16 bits).
> For example: `0000011111111011`
* A group of **8 bits** is called a **byte**.

## **3.1.2 Data Compression**

To save memory space, data is usually **compressed** before being stored.

* Data compression **reduces file size** while keeping the important information.
* It’s an advanced topic, explained fully in ***Chapter 15***.

## **3.1.3 Error Detection and Correction**

When **data is transmitted or stored**, **errors can occur**. These errors might change one or more bits in the data, which can lead to incorrect or corrupted information.


### 🛠️ Solutions:

To handle this problem, computers use **error detection and correction techniques**.
These are **special methods** that help:

* **Find (detect)** if an error occurred.
* **Fix (correct)** it if possible.

> 🔍 More details on these techniques are provided in **Appendix H** of the book.
