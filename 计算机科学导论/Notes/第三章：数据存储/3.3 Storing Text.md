## âœ… 3.3 Storing Text

Text is a **sequence of symbols**, and each symbol can be stored as a **bit pattern** in a computer.

### ðŸ“Œ Symbols in Text

Examples of symbols:

* **Letters**: Aâ€“Z (uppercase), aâ€“z (lowercase)
* **Digits**: 0â€“9 (as symbols, not numbers)
* **Punctuation**: `. , ? : ; !`
* **Other characters**: Space, newline, tab, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ How Many Bits Do We Need?

It follows a **logarithmic** pattern:

If we want to encode **N** symbols, we need at least `logâ‚‚(N)` bits.

## âœ… 3.3.1 Codes

A **code** is a set of bit patterns assigned to represent text symbols.

### ðŸ”¹ ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

* Developed by ANSI
* Uses **7 bits per symbol**
* Can represent **128 symbols**: letters, digits, punctuation, and control codes
* Example:

  * `'A'` â†’ `1000001` (binary)
  * `'a'` â†’ `1100001` (binary)

### ðŸ”¹ Unicode

* Developed by a global consortium
* Uses **32 bits per symbol**
* Can represent up to **2Â³Â² = 4,294,967,296** symbols
* Includes **characters from all major world languages**
* ASCII is a **subset** of Unicode
* Also supports:

  * Emojis ðŸ˜Š
  * Mathematical symbols âˆ‘
  * Foreign scripts (æ±‰å­—, Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù‰)
